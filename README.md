# Problem Statement : 

People prefer prepared items over homemade ones in today's fast-paced environment. One industry that has gained popularity and growth by virtue of this fact is the hotel sector. Every day, millions of people eat in hotels and restaurants, making it a multimillion-dollar industry. Two key success elements in this firm are managing food waste and customer happiness. It is difficult but necessary to retain existing customers and draw in new ones for the restaurant to run properly. However, just by looking at the dishes' names, we might not fully understand what are they.

Many questions arise, like what ingredients are utilized, how the food is served, how much is provided, etc. Customers won't be interested in tasting new foods with these questions in their minds. Also, because customers place orders without knowing how much food would be given, there is a potential that food will go to waste.

# Solution:
Our app was created with the intention of resolving the aforementioned problems utilizing augmented reality, a fast-developing technology. AR can be envisioned from a variety of perspectives, including 3D object visualization, real-time user interaction, and fusing physical and virtual surroundings.People today are more likely to use ordering platforms or customer support channels that are farther away and have less direct human contact. In the restaurant sector, an AR-based 3D menu can give customers a better experience by allowing them to learn more about the products and make wiser purchasing decisions. The idea might make a great  business plan for a single app that allows users to order any food from wherever and place an order.
