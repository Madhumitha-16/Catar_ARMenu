# Catar_ARMenu

People today are more likely to use ordering platforms or customer support channels that are farther away and have less direct human contact.

In the restaurant sector, an AR-based 3D menu can give customers a better experience by allowing them to learn more about the products and make wiser purchasing decisions. 

The idea might make a great  business plan for a single app that allows users to order any food from wherever and place an order.
